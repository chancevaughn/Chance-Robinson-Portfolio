The webpage will respond dynamically to the size of screen that is presented upon. Whether it is on a mobile phone, tablet, or laptop, the screen will be optimized for the best viewing experince.

## Experience The Magic

All the features of this website are able be experienced on a laptop. 

So give it a try!

Try resizing the screen, clicking on one of the subheader tabs, clicking on the image of one work images, or one of the contact buttons. They will all respond as you imagine it. The contact buttons will even create a path to contact me in that specified method!
